# CMU_LTI_Summer_Internship

## What motivated me to apply to this program?

**Research Interests**

As an undergraduate student studying artificial intelligence and cognitive science, I am broadly interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms of human social cognition and developing socially intelligent systems that can interact with humans safely. I believe language serves as a cornerstone for human thought, reasoning, and social interaction. Inspired by recent advancements in generative agents and social simulation, my specific research interests include:

1. Designing experiments and benchmarks to evaluate social intelligence in generative-agent-based environments, drawing insights from social psychology.
2. Leveraging generative-agent-based environments as social simulators to study social dynamics, particularly the emergence and evolution of social norms and institutions.
3. Evaluating large language models (LLMs) through the lens of cognitive science and designing more human-like language models.
4. AI ethics, fairness, and the application of AI for social good.

**Goals for This Program**

I am eager to join this program to collaborate with leading researchers in language technology. In particular, I am inspired by Prof. **Maarten Sap**’s work on assessing AI agent safety within complex social interactions and interactively training LLMs to enhance their social intelligence. Additionally, I greatly admire Prof. **Yonatan Bisk**’s research on improving LLMs’ theory-of-mind reasoning and incorporating inductive biases into language models. Furthermore, Prof. **Louis-Philippe Morency**’s research on artificial social intelligence strongly aligns with my passion for building socially aware AI systems by integrating and analyzing multimodal information.

With my background at the intersection of AI, cognitive science, and social science, I believe I can make meaningful contributions to this program and the CMU LTI community.
